# Solution for Firefox showing context menus and password popups at the wrong position 

In some constellations, Firefox shows context menus at a complete different position on the screen, especially when the window was dragged to the left or right screen side so that it snaps in and fills 50% of the screen (known as "Aero Snap" on Windows).

Fix:
1. Right-click on the title bar -> "Customize Toolbar..."
2. On the bottom, uncheck the checkbox "Title Bar"

That's it! Without the title bar, all menus and popups are shown on the correct position!
